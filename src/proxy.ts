// middleware that is not configurable. That removes the constraint this file used to work
// around — Prisma could now run here — but the MCP token check stays in the route regardless,
// because a per-request database lookup on the gate that fronts every request is a cost with no
// matching benefit. See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §6.

 * path down, which is the only honest value for the provider log's `feature`: anything else
 * would be a name someone chose for a route rather than the route.
 *
 * Any inbound value is deleted before ours is written. `set` would replace it anyway; the
 * `delete` is here so that remains true of this function rather than of Headers' semantics. The
 * field is only a label, but a label an outsider can forge is worse than none — it puts a name
